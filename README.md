Prisoner
========

A Python prisoner's dilemma competition adjudicator, written in [Coconut](https://github.com/evhub/coconut).

## Instructions

First, create a Python file containing this code:
```
from prisoner.dilemma import *

@pd_bot
def my_bot_name(self_hist, opp_hist, opp_bot):
    <code>
```

Next, in place of `<code>`, insert whatever Python code you want that returns either `True` for cooperate or `False` for defect.
